I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in the [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in Computer Science. I am fortunate to collaborate with Prof. [Yifan Song](https://crypto-song.github.io/) at Tsinghua and Prof. [Wenting Zheng](https://wzheng.github.io/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interests span the theoretical foundations and practical applications of cryptography. I focus on making cryptographic protocols more efficient and easier to deploy in real-world systems. I am also interested in post‑quantum and quantum cryptography.

I am seeking PhD positions beginning Fall 2026 and would welcome inquiries from potential advisors or collaborators.
